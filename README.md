# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL (MySQL)

## üìñ Introduction
The ability to analyze sales data effectively is a crucial requirement for businesses in the food and beverage industry.  
This project, **Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL**, focuses on extracting meaningful insights from a pizza sales dataset using **MySQL Workbench**.  

The project is designed to demonstrate how structured query language (SQL) can be applied to:  
- Organize raw sales data into a relational database,  
- Perform queries ranging from basic retrieval to advanced analytics, and  
- Generate insights that support decision-making in areas such as sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends.  

A relational database consisting of four key tables was created:  
- **orders** ‚Äì containing details of order IDs, dates, and times,  
- **order_details** ‚Äì recording individual items within each order,  
- **pizzas** ‚Äì storing pizza identifiers, sizes, and prices,  
- **pizza_types** ‚Äì categorizing pizzas by type and category.  

On this structured dataset, a series of **13 SQL queries** were executed. These queries covered essential analytical tasks such as identifying total sales, determining the highest-priced and most popular pizzas, analyzing customer ordering behavior by time of day, studying sales distribution across categories, and evaluating revenue contribution and growth over time.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used not only for simple data retrieval but also for advanced business analytics.  
By applying aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, and window functions, it was possible to transform raw sales data into actionable insights.  

The study highlights that structured database queries can help businesses:  
- Optimize their menu by focusing on high-performing pizzas,  
- Adjust operations around peak demand times, and  
- Strategically manage product categories for maximum revenue contribution.  

Overall, this project emphasizes the role of **SQL as a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making** and serves as a strong foundation for further work in business intelligence and analytics.
